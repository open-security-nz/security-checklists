### Identifying security impact of new software features

### Purpose
It’s much easier to design security into our solutions from the start rather than try to retrofit it at the end. 

This checklist helps to identify stories and requirements that might need a little extra security involvement.

By identifying and labelling a story, we can provide extra assistance such as architecture review, threat assessment, coaching/training, security testing, vulnerability assessment, security monitoring and alerting.


### Does your story meet any of the following criteria?

- [ ]	Does this story implement or change Authentication or Authorisation functionality?

- [ ]	Does this story involve the build, deployment or reconfiguration of Infrastructure?

- [ ]	Does this story change or create externally accessible functionality or services?

- [ ]	Does this story handle sensitive data? 
such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Credit Cards, secret keys, passwords, tokens

- [ ]	Does this story require an integration with a 3rd party organisation, end point or data source?



### What should you do next?

1.	Simply answer the questions listed on this card for your story.

2.	If you answered ‘yes’ or ticked the box for any of these questions, add the ‘Security’ label to the story in your ticketing or tracking system.

3.	If your team uses chat software such as Slack, reach out in the security channel to get additional help
